# ðŸŽ­ ProxatoreBot
This Telegram bot uses [Proxatore](https://github.com/octospacc/Proxatore) for viewing and embedding media from various social network platforms and websites to be able to view and download them without leaving your chat!

**Try it now** using the [official instance](https://t.me/ProxatoreBot) or host your own!
You can use this bot in private chat to get your proxied links to copy and share, or, directly and faster, in inline mode in every Telegram chat.

## How to host
Running this bot requires Python â‰¥ 3.10 and  ```python-telegram-bot ``` v20+. After getting those, just download [the script](/proxatorebot.py), replace the ```BOT_TOKEN``` variable with your own token obtained from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and, if needed, edit the list of the istances the bot will use (please head to [Proxatore repo](https://github.com/octospacc/Proxatore?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-self-host) if you need to host your own Proxatore instance).
